# A-Hybrid-Quantum-Classical-Framework-for-Reinforcement-Learning-of-Atari-Games
This repo explores the capabilities of hybrid quantum-classical models based on variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) in high dimensional reinforcement learning (RL) environments such as the Atari 2600 classics Pong and Breakout.
